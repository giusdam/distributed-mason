Launching Distribution:

1. Have an AWS account with Root permissions.
2. Have awscli installed
3. Configure awscli with the following:

$ aws configure

It will ask you for you Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, AWS region, and output format.

To find this information, in the AWS Management console
$your_username -> My Security Credentials -> (It'll probably ask you if you want to continue. For the purposes of this, just press Continue)
-> Access keys

If you don't already know your Secret Access Key or you don't have any keys created, then, go to Create New Access Key.
It will generate your Access Key ID and Secret Access Key. You'll want to download them for not losing access stuff.

So provide that information.

AWS region, I'm using us-east-1 (being based in GMU, Northern Virginia is a good idea).

An alternative to using $(aws configure) is just creating the following files with the information filled in

#In file ~/.aws/config ; Fill in region as appropriate.
[default]
region = us-east-1

#In file ~/.aws/credentials
[default]
aws_access_key_id = $access_key_id
aws_secret_access_key = $secret_access_key

4. Go get your PEM file.
ec2 -> Network & Security -> Key Pairs -> Create Key Pairs
I'd name it mason. And then download the pem file and put it in ~/.ssh/

You'll need to chmod it, `chmod g-r ~/.ssh/$pemfile.pem; chmod o-r ~/.ssh/$pemfile.pem`

5. Setup Security Groups
ec2 -> Network & Security -> Security Groups -> Create Security Group

Name it how you will and give description. The default VPC is fine unless you have a specific VPC for it.
Not super secure, but using "Add Rule", add two rules:
1. Custom TCP, TCP, 0-65535, Anywhere
2. SSH, TCP, 22, Anywhere

Keep the Security Group ID around (referred to as sgid)

6. Setup the Subnet.
ec2 -> Default VPC -> Virtual Private Cloud -> Subnets

You'll have a subnet already, so if you don't want a specific subnet for a specific VPC, just keep a subnet id around.
Else, just create the subnet.

7. Edit aws-setup/aws-config
Change the appropriate variables.
In particular, the "key", "security_gid", and "subnet_id".

8. Launch aws-setup/aws-setup.sh

9. -- When you're done, Launch, aws-setup/aws-teardown.sh
